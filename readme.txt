=========

This self-extracting file contains the FFTW AddOn for J.

FFTW is a collection of fast C routines for computing the Discrete Fourier
Transform in one or more dimensions. It includes complex, real, and
parallel transforms, and can handle arbitrary array sizes efficiently.

The FFTW AddOn consists of a DLL incorporating the FFTW routines, plus
supporting J scripts and labs. The Addon is currently only available for
Windows and Linux.

FFTW was developed at MIT by Matteo Frigo and Steven G. Johnson, and a full
description is available at the FFTW home page:
